# PropertyManager

Simple demo property manager application for job application.

The application displays a list of properties using a statid data set within the “results" array running down the page in a column that has a heading labeled **Results**. A second column exists with a heading **Saved Properties**, along side the Results column. It contains an initial saved property.

Hovering over a property card in the Results column displays an **add** button. Clicking the **add** button creates the property in the Saved Properties column. Hovering over a property card in the Saved Properties column will display a **remove** button. Clicking the **remove** button removes the property from the list of saved properties.
